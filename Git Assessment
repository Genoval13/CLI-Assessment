Why do we use Git?
It allows us to save our progress at a specific stage in development and allows us to return to that stage in the future if changes were introduced that created issues.

What is the difference between Git and Github?
Git is just a way to save the progress made, where as GitHub is where that progress is actually saved to. Git just packages your information for GitHub or another Git database.

How does Git work?
Git basically saves data in different stages, which are unstaged, staged, and committed. Unstaged means that changes in the Git will not be pushed into future "snapshots", or saves, of the Git repository. Staged means that the changes are included in future versions, and finally committed means that the change has stuck around long enuogh to be in previous snapshots.

What is a Git repository?
It is a directory on your local computer that has been initialized by Git.

Initialize a Git repository
To do so, within the CLI type
  git init
