Why do we use a CLI?
The command line interface is used to write and execute programs faster and more efficiently. It allows you to complete repetitive tasks automatically as well.

What is the difference between shell and terminal?
A shell is broad term referring to any interface that interacts with the OS. A terminal refers specifically to the command line that interacts directly with the OS.

What are flags?
Command flags are just shorthand for telling the command line to use certain options, like long list( ls -l), list all (ls -a), etc. 

What are file permissions and why do they exist?
File permissions specify who can can do what with a particular file. They exist for security; if you have a private file that you don't want to let everyone see, you can restrict the read permission to your own account and those in the group you chose. 

- `cd` - change directory
- `touch` - create file
- `ls` - list
- `pwd` - current working directory
- `mkdir` - create new directory
- `rm` - remove
- `sudo` - give executive permissions? (not mentioned in either reading)
- `cat` - concatenate, or to link things together
